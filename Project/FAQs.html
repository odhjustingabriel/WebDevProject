          <b>Question:</b> 
          <div class="q">  Do I need to make an appointment? <br />

          </div>
          <div id="Answer" style="font-size: 15px;">
          Answer: Generally speaking, yes. However, there are times that we are
          able to accommodate clients that walk-in without an appointment. Most
          often, because of our full staff of therapists, <br />
          you can make your appointment for the same day you call.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please arrive at least ten minutes before your scheduled appointment
          in order to assure a full massage session. </div>

          <b>Question:</b> 
          <div class="q"> What is your cancellation policy?
            <br /> 
          <br></div>
          </div>
          <div id="Answer" style="font-size: 15px;">
          Answer: Appointments can be canceled for free with a 24 hour notice.
          Same day cancellations or rescheduling same day will be charged a
          Kshs.300 reservation fee per person. Appointments cancelled with less
          than a one hour notice or no notice at all will be charged full value
          of the service and recorded as a “No Show”. Please note, when booking
          an appointment you are reserving a treatment room and a Licensed
          Massage Therapist. Our Therapist work for commission only and this
          policy ensures they receive compensation if a client does not show up.
          Front desk associates are not allowed to an appointment without a
          credit card on file or a Kshs.300 cash deposit. If you need to cancel
          your appointment please call 0798765432. Thank you for understanding! </div>

          <b>Question:</b> 
          <div class="q">  Can I choose my own therapist? <br /> 
            <br></div>
          </div>
          <div id="Answer" style="font-size: 15px;">
          Answer: Yes, you can choose your therapist but you may have to wait
          for an appointment depending on the therapists’ schedule, availability
          and popularity. But if you need an appointment today, we can find an
          opening on someone’s schedule. You can also request your preference in
          male or female therapist. Our philosophy at Gabriel Massage Center is
          to help you find your fit with the therapist and treatment style that
          best serves you. You can choose to change therapists at anytime during
          your treatment plan, establish a primary therapist and/or utilize each
          therapist at different points in time during your relationship to
          Gabriel Massage Center. We understand the need for consistency, change
          and spontaneity and we can be all of those things to you and more. We
          want you to feel welcome to try any of us at Gabriel Massage Center. </div>

          <div id="Question" style="font-size: 19px;">
          <b>Question:</b> 
          <div class="q"> How flexible are your services? <br /> 
            <br> </div>
          </div>
          <div id="Answer" style="font-size: 15px;">
          Answer: We have had frequent customers question our flexibility in
          services which prompted us to endorse a new program to cater for their
          needs. We started a Massage-At-Home program where one books for a
          massage appointment to be done at the comfort of their own home.
          Howeverthis comes with some extra costs which are determined after the
          massuese has visited your home. It should also be noted that for one
          to book for this, <br />
          BOOKING SHOULD BE DONE ATLEAST A FORTNIGHT AWAY FROM THE PLANNED DATE! </div>
